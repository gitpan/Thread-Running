=head1 NAME

Thread::Running - provide non-blocking check whether threads are running

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Thread::Running;      # exports running(), exited() and tojoin()
    use Thread::Running qw(running);   # only exports running()
    use Thread::Running ();   # threads class methods only

    my $thread = threads->new( sub { whatever } );
    while ($thread->running) {
    # do your stuff
    }

    $_->join foreach threads->tojoin;

    until (threads->exited( $tid )) {
    # do your stuff
    }

    sleep 1 while threads->running;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

                  *** A note of CAUTION ***

 This module only functions on Perl versions 5.8.0 and later.
 And then only when threads are enabled with -Dusethreads.  It
 is of no use with any version of Perl before 5.8.0 or without
 threads enabled.

                  *************************

This module adds three features to threads that are sorely missed by some:
you can check whether a thread is running, whether it can be joined or whether
it has exited without waiting for that thread to be finished (non-blocking).

=head1 CLASS METHODS

These are the class methods.

=head2 running

 sleep 1 while threads->running; # wait until all threads stopped running

 sleep 1 while $thread->running; # wait until this thread stopped running

 @running = threads->running( @thread );  # list of threads still running

 while (running( @tid )) {  # subroutine: while at least 1 is still running
 # do your stuff
 }

The "running" method allows you to check whether one or more threads are
still running.  It accepts one or more thread objects or thread ID's (as
obtained by the C<threads::tid()> method).

If called as a class method or as a subroutine without parameters, then it
will check all threads of which it knows.  If called as an instance method
without parameters, it will only check the thread associated with the object.

In list context it returns the thread ID's of the threads that are still
running.  In scalar context, it just returns 1 or 0 to indicate whether any
of the (implicitely) indicated threads is still running.

=head2 tojoin

 sleep 1 until threads->tojoin; # wait until any thread can be joined

 sleep 1 until $thread->tojoin; # wait until this thread can be joined

 warn "Come on and join!\n" if threads->tojoin( $thread );

 $_->join foreach threads->tojoin; # join all joinable threads

The "tojoin" method allows you to check whether one or more threads have
finished executing and can be joined.  It accepts one or more thread objects
or thread ID's (as obtained by the C<threads::tid()> method).

If called as a class method or as a subroutine without parameters, then it
will check all threads of which it knows.  If called as an instance method
without parameters, it will only check the thread associated with the object.

In list context it returns thread objects of the threads that can be joined.
In scalar context, it just returns 1 or 0 to indicate whether any of the
(implicitely) indicated threads is can be joined.

=head2 exited

 sleep 1 until $thread->exited; # wait until this thread exited

 sleep 1 until threads->exited; # wait until all threads exited

 @exited = threads->exited( @thread ); # threads that have exited

 until (exited( @tid )) { # subroutine: until all have exited
 # do your stuff
 }

The "exited" method allows you to check whether all of one or more threads
have exited.  It accepts one or more thread objects or thread ID's (as
obtained by the C<threads::tid()> method).

If called as a class method or as a subroutine without parameters, then it
will check all threads of which it knows.  If called as an instance method
without parameters, it will only check the thread associated with the object.

In list context it returns the thread ID's of the threads that have exited.
In scalar context, it just returns 1 or 0 to indicate whether B<all> of the
(implicitely) indicated threads have exited.

=head1 CAVEATS

This module is dependent on the L<Thread::Exit> module, with all of its
CAVEATS applicable.

=head1 TODO

Examples should be added.
